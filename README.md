# Thesis
This repository contains the code and experiments for my master's thesis on **generative inverse design with language models**, with a focus on exploring the practical application of genAI in real-world  drug design scenarios.

The repository is organized to separate model code, configuration files, checkpoints, and datasets for clarity and reproducibility.
