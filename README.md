# Thesis
This repository contains the code and experiments for my master's thesis on **generative inverse design with language models**, with a focus on exploring the practical application of genAI in real-world drug design scenarios.

The repository is organized as follow:


```
├── chemprop/                           # Code/setup for Chemprop model
├── configs/                            # Configuration files for experiments
├── gradientboosting/                   # Code for Gradient Boosting model
├── ckpt_experiment3_chemprop/          # Chemprop checkpoints (Experiment 3)
├── ckpt_experiment3_gradientboosting/  # GB checkpoints (Experiment 3)
├── ckpt_experiment4_chemprop/          # Chemprop checkpoints (Experiment 4)
├── ckpt_experiment4_gradientboosting/  # GB checkpoints (Experiment 4)
├── saturn_mods/                        # Modified SATURN code
├── data/                               # Training datasets for surrogate models
